/*
  In JS, you can use both single and double quotes to enclose string literals. However, you must match them.

  Therefore, there are times when using single quotes makes more sense than double quotes, and vice versa.

  In this problem, we switch from using enclosing double quotes to single quotes so that we don't need to use escape double quotes inside of the string literal.
