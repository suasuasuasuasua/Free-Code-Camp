/*
  In JS, strings are immutable, meaning that once you create them they cannot be altered using bracket notation. 

  This means that a string variable can only be changed if it is assigned a new string literal.
*/

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
