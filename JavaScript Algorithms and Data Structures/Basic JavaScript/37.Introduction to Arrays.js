/*
  In JS, you create an array by declaring a 'var' as usual, except that you will enclose the array's contents within brackets, where the contents are separated with commas

  ex. myArray = [1, 2, 3, "4"]

  Note that in JS, arrays can contain values of different data types

// Only change code below this line
var myArray = ["string", 10];
