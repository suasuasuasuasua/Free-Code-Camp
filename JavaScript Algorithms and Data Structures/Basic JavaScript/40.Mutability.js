/*
  Arrays are mutable, meaning that individual components within the array can be changed.

  In this problem, myArray[0] is initially 18, but we are allowed to change it to 45.

  Remember, strings do not behave this way.

// Setup
var myArray = [18,64,99];

// Only change code below this line
myArray[0] = 45;
