/*
  Functions are useful because you can them as many times as you want.

  We declare them in this format:

    function functionName(//parameters if you need any) {
      ... // do something
    }

  To call the function, we call the function's name, as well as parenthesis and the necessary arguments.

  When functions are called, the code between the function's curly brackets will be executed.
