<!--
  We can style the body element just like any other HTML element.

  Any element that is contained within <body> will inherit its properties.

  In this problem, even though we do not declare a class or specify a specific guideline for h1 elements, the 'Hello World' is still changed.
-->

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1> Hello World </h1>
