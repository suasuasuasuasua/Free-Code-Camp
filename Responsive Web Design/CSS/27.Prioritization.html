<!--
  When HTML elements recieve multiple stlyes that conflict with one another, we need to think about priority.

  In this problem, all body elements will be colored green, but we also assign a 'pink-text' class to the h1 element.

  It turns out that class selectors will override the body element's property.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class = "pink-text">Hello World!</h1>
