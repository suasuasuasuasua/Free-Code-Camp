<!--
  We have just found out that class selectors will override general stylings.

  In this problem, we declare a second class called blue-text.

  I assign both of the classes to the h1 element, but it turns out that the resulting h1 will become blue because the blue-text class is declared after the pink-text class. 

  Therefore, the order in which the classes are declared in the <h1 class = "..."> does not matter. The only thing that matters is when the class was declared.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>
