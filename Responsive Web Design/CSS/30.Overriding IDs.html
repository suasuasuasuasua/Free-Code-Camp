<!--
  Using inline styles, we can override even ID stylings.

  The format would look something like this:

  <h1 style = "color: green;"> ... </h1>

  In this assignment, note that h1 has two classes assigned to it, as well as an ID styling. 

  It turns out that the text will end up white because inline styling takes precedence.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text" style = "color: white;">Hello World!</h1>
