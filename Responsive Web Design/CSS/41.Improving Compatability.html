<!--
  In the case that your CSS cannot be parsed, a browser will simply ignore what it cannot understand and use default values.

  This is obviously not ideal, so a fine workaround is to declare a broswer fallback. This is so we can compensate for older browsers like Internet Explorer, which cannot understand variables.

  In this problem, all we do is declare two background attributes, such that the original red will be used if the browser cannot recognize variables.

<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {
    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
  }
</style>
<div class="red-box"></div>
