<!--
  To create more complex websites, we can use the ideas of nested objects.

  For example, we can put anchors within paragraphs to allow the user to click on links in the middle of text.

  We achieve this by following the general structure:

  <p> This is my <a target = "_blank" href = "URL"> link </a> </p>,
  where target is an anchor attribute that specifies where to open the link. In our case _blank specifies to open the link in a new tab
  href defines the URL that the anchor will lead to 

  The trickiest part about this is remembering where to start and end the angle brackets
