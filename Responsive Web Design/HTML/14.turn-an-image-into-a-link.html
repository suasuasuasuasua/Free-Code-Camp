<!--
  We can even make elements into links by nesting them within anchor elements.

  We do this by simply putting whatever we want between <a > </a>, and then we set href = "#"

  After this is done, whenever we hover our mouse over the element, our cursor's normal pointer should now become the link clicking pointer.

  Therefore, in this case, the photo of the cat we had before is now a link (one that happens to be 'dead')...
