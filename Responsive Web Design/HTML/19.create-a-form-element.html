<!--
  The webforms in their current state are not useful at all. 
  
  However, we can actually submit the data to a server using nothing more than HTML. 

  We do this by specifiying an action attribute on the form element. 

  For example: 

  <form action = "url where you want to submit form data">
    <input>
  </form>

  In our example, the data that we submit will be directed to the free-cat-photo-app website.
