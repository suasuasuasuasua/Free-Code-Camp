<!--
  Another type of form besides a text based entry is through radio buttons.

  We follow a similar a format like this, where we nest the <input> within a <form> tag, like we would for text based entries

  <form>
    <label for = "option 1"> 
      <input id = "option 1" type = "radio" name = "question 1"> Option 1
    </label>
    
    <label for = "option 2"> 
      <input id = "option 2" type = "radio" name = "question 1"> Option 2
    </label>

    ...
  
  </form>

  Note how we declare the ID tag in the input, then reference it right above using 'for'. This provides more clarity and is regarded as best practice.
