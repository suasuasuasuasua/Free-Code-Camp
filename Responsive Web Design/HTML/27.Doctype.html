<!--
  When we create an HTML file, the first thing we need to do is declare the HTML version that we will be using.

  We do this by stating <!DOCTYPE ...>, where !DOCTYPE is case sensitive and very specific.

  ... can be any version of HTML. For our purposes we can just enter 'html', which refers to HTML5

  Next, we have to state <html></html>.

  We have to put everything we will use inside of those two tags, where <html> starts everything and </html> goes at the very end.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<h1>
  Hello world!
</h1>

</html>
