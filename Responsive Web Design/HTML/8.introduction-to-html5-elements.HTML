<!--
The introduction of HTML brought about many useful tags beyond header and paragraph tags, such as main, video, etc.

Here we practice with <main>, which describes where the main body of text is on your website.

Because our two <p> tags are nested within the <main> tag, they are interpreted as 'children' of <main>
