<!--
Another tag that we can use is called <img>

<img> is useful because we can display images from the internet (given the URL) on our own webpages.

The general format goes like:

<img src = "link" alt = "text">

Note how we do not have to declare a closing <img> statement.

Moreover, note how we have to have the src, denoting the source of the image, i.e. the image URL.

Adding the 'alt' text is not required, but it is good practice, especially when the image cannot load
